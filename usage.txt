usage: input_file resolution [-o output_prefix] [-b begin_coordinate] [-e end_coordinate] [-k lower_dimension] [-l regularization_strength] [-r neighborhood_radius] [-t sparsity_threshold] [-sfg]

example: ./grinch Gm12878_chr1_25kb.txt 25000 -o Gm12878_chr1 

input_file: 
	tab-delimited file location and name, each line 
	contains chromosome and start/end location for 
	loci 1 and loci 2, followed by interaction count, 
	e.g.,chr1 0 25000 chr1 25000 50000 8019.7
resolution: 
	number of base pairs in a bin, e.g., 25000
-o output_prefix: 
	Default is "output". -o Gm12878_chr1 would create 
	output files prefixed with Gm12878_chr1.
-b coordinate, -e coordinate: 
	Default is the smallest bin location and the 
	largest bin location in input file. If you want to 
	find TADs in a subregion of the input file, specify 
	the starting bin location and/or the ending bin 
	location, e.g., -b 91000000 -e 94000000. Inclusive
	of ending bin location.
-k lower_dimension: 
	Default is the number of rows (or columns since 
	symmetric) in input matrix / (1000000/resolution). 
	Specifies the lower dimension of the factors.
-l regularization_strength: 
	Default is 1. Higher means the influence of the 
	graph will be higher when regularizing the factors.
-r neighborhood_radius: 
	Default is 4. Number of neighbors on either side 
	of a given genonic region that will regularize the 
	region during factorization.
-t sparsity_threshod: 
	Default is 50. Minimum number of elements required 
	in a row/column so that the row/column is included 
	in the factorization. 0 means no sparse rows/colums
	are filtered out. 1 means completely empty rows/
	columns are filtered out. 50 means rows with fewer 
	than 50 counts will be fitlered out.
-s: 
	Print to file the smoothed matrix, in tab-delimited 
	sparse format (e.g. 25000 50000 500.3). File may be
	large.
-f: 
	Print to file the factor U, after row-normalization. 
	First column is the genomic region, and the following
	k columns are the latent feature values from the 
	factor, e.g., 50000 0.3 0.1 ..., tab-delimited. File
	may be large, especially for higher-resolution input.
-g:	Print to file the graph used in regularization. File
	may be large, since the matrix is written in a dense
	format.
